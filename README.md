### Remapping the Input
- Go to the KeyMappings.h and add or change the GLFW Key

## Modify the Engine
### Add Meshes
‚ö†Ô∏è OpenGLEngine only support .obj file. For the FBX File, you need to install the FBX SDK from Autodesk and implement the logic yourself.
- Add the Model in the Models Folder
- Open the ResourcePaths.h and add the path to your(s) model(s) in the namespace Models
- Open the main.cpp, Add a new variable of the name you want who is a model
- Go to the InitializeModels() and add the Model. 

‚úîÔ∏è For now the model and his resource are loaded but now you need to display him ! 
- Go to the main and search for the RenderScene()
- Call the Render3DModelObject and set has parameters the name of your model and the properties you want (Position, RotationAngle, Axis, Scale)
‚úÖ If you follow all this step, now you have the Model display in the Engine.

### Add Skybox Textures
- Add the Skybox Texture in the Textures/Skybox Folder (Create a new folder for your Skybox)
- Open the ResourcePaths.h and add the path to your(s) Skybox Texture(s) in the namespace Skybox (create a new one for simplicity)
#### Order of Skybox Textures
1. Right or pz
2. Left or nz
3. Top or py
4. Down or ny
5. Back or nx
6. Front or px

- Now, go to Skybox.h and add a new name in the Skybox enum class then go to GetSkyboxPaths and add a new case with your skybox 


‚úîÔ∏è For now you be ready to use the Skybox you add !
#### Two Options :
1. Go to the main.cpp, search for the InitializeSkybox() and change the namespace to your skybox
2. Go to the main.cpp, search for the SwitchSkybox(), add a new declaration and a new input for changing to your skybox
‚úÖ If you follow all this step, now you have the Model display in the Engine.
